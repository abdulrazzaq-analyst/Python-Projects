# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects

## 📌 About This Folder
This folder contains my **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** projects created using Python.  
Each project focuses on analyzing a specific dataset to identify patterns, trends, and insights that can help in data-driven decision-making.  

As I continue to work on different datasets, I will keep adding more EDA projects here.

## 📊 General EDA Workflow
1. **Data Importing** – Load dataset  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handle missing values, duplicates, and incorrect formats  
3. **Exploratory Analysis** – Understand dataset structure, summary statistics  
4. **Feature Engineering** – Create new useful variables  
5. **Visualization** – Generate charts, plots, and graphs for insights  
6. **Insights Extraction** – Highlight important patterns and business conclusions
