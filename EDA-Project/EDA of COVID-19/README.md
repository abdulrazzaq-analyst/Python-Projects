# COVID-19 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This project involves an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of COVID-19 data collected from the **World Health Organization (WHO)** website. The analysis aims to uncover patterns, trends, and insights about COVID-19 cases and deaths globally, across different countries and regions.

The dataset contains daily reported COVID-19 cases and deaths from **4th January 2020 to 3rd August 2025**.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:

- `Date_reported`: The date of reporting
- `Country`: Name of the country
- `WHO_region`: WHO designated region
- `New_cases`: New COVID-19 cases reported
- `Cumulative_cases`: Total cases reported till date
- `New_deaths`: New COVID-19 deaths reported
- `Cumulative_deaths`: Total deaths reported till date

> **Note:** Some countries have never reported COVID-19 cases or deaths.

## Objective
The main objectives of this EDA are:

1. Identify countries and regions most affected by COVID-19.
2. Analyze trends in cases and deaths over time.
3. Compare death ratios among different WHO regions.
4. Highlight countries with no reported COVID-19 cases or deaths.
5. Visualize insights through graphs like line plots, bar plots, pie charts, and heatmaps.

## Key Insights
- The **USA** recorded the highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths.
- **Europe** reported the most cases regionally, while the **Americas** accounted for the highest deaths.
- Several countries have never reported any COVID-19 cases or deaths.
- Global death ratios vary significantly across WHO regions.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (for analysis and reporting)

## Insights & Visualizations
- Sales trends over publishing years
- Top genres and their contribution to sales
- Distribution of author ratings and their effect on sales
- Publisher-wise revenue comparison
- Language-wise sales segmentation
